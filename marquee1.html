    n a client-server architecture, clients interact with servers by making requests for data or resources that the client is not capable of providing. Clients and servers can be located in different areas and connect via a network. They can also be located on the same machine and connect by interprocess communications.

A distributed application framework divides tasks between servers and clients. Tasks that can be completed by the client are typically referred to as client-side, while tasks completed by a server are referred to as server-side.

Servers typically provide resources such as files, data, internet access, external storage or processing power. The server puts one or more programs in charge of distributing those services to requesting clients.
