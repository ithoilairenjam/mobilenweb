    The usap.gov website
    A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Examples of notable websites are Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Wikipedia.
    
    All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal website for its employees.
    
    Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment or social networking. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.
    
    Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called a Web browser.This article is about websites in general. For the Internet domain .website, see List of Internet top-level domains.

<h2> Client</h2>
sed in home and corporate networks, a client is any computer hardware or software device that requests access to a service provided by a server. Clients are typically seen as the requesting program or user in a client-server architecture. Client end-user devices typically include desktop computers, laptops and smartphones. 

In a computer network, a client in a client-server model is what requests a service or resource from a server. The server can be located on or off premises.

<h2><a name="server"> Server</a></h2>
n a client-server architecture, clients interact with servers by making requests for data or resources that the client is not capable of providing. Clients and servers can be located in different areas and connect via a network. They can also be located on the same machine and connect by interprocess communications.

A distributed application framework divides tasks between servers and clients. Tasks that can be completed by the client are typically referred to as client-side, while tasks completed by a server are referred to as server-side.

Servers typically provide resources such as files, data, internet access, external storage or processing power. The server puts one or more programs in charge of distributing those services to requesting clients.
